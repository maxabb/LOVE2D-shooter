**For those who want to modify some things
*  if you want bullets to be faster, edit the "velocity" global variable (higher is faster)
*  if you want the player to move faster, edit the s variable in the players table (higher is faster)
* if you want the player to fire faster edit the d variable in the players table (lower is faster)
* the enemies spawn rate lowers overtime by default, but if you wanted to start with it higher edit the enemyDelay global variable (lower is faster)
